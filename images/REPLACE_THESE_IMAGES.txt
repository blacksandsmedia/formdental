🦷 FORM DENTAL - REPLACE PLACEHOLDER IMAGES 🦷

I've created your website with placeholder images. To complete your site, 
please replace these 4 files with your beautiful smile photos:

REPLACE THESE FILES:
📄 smile-1.jpg ← The confident male smile (used as background image)
📄 smile-2.jpg ← The female smile with coral lips (About section)  
📄 smile-3.jpg ← The open mouth smile (Services section)
📄 smile-4.jpg ← The close-up female smile (Experience section)

HOW TO REPLACE:
1. Right-click on each photo you want to use
2. Save them to this 'images' folder
3. Rename them exactly as: smile-1.jpg, smile-2.jpg, smile-3.jpg, smile-4.jpg
4. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:8000

✨ The images are now spread throughout your homepage:
• smile-1.jpg = Full-width background section with text overlay
• smile-2.jpg = About section (next to Dr. Phillips text)
• smile-3.jpg = Floating accent in Services section  
• smile-4.jpg = Experience section image

🎨 LOGO UPDATES COMPLETED:
• 'FORM' now has 100px letter spacing and normal weight
• 'DENTAL' is smaller with 200px letter spacing
• Line spacing is 1.4 between them

Your website will look stunning once you add the real photos!
